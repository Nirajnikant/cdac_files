            He made his directorial debut in 1992 with his first movie Praying with Anger.

Afterward, Shyamalan released a series of poorly received but sometimes financially successful movies, including the dark fantasy Lady in the Water (2006), the eco-thriller The Happening (2008), The Last Airbender (2010) (an adaptation based on the first season of the Nickelodeon animated television series Avatar: The Last Airbender), and the science fiction film After Earth (2013).
         <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the financial failure of After Earth, Shyamalan's career was revived with the release of the found footage horror film The Visit (2015), the psychological thriller Split (2016), and the comic book thriller Glass (2019). With a total budget of $34 million between them, these three films earned a combined box office of $625 million. Glass is the third and final chapter of his Unbreakable film series, which commenced in 2000. His latest feature film was the supernatural thriller film Old, which was released in 2021 to mixed reviews, but grossed over $90 million on a budget of $18 million.
