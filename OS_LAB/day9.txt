1. Given memory partitions of 100K, 500K, 200K, 300K, and 600K (in order),
how would each of the First-fit, Best-fit, and Worst-fit algorithms place
processes of 212K, 417K, 112K, and 426K (in order)? Which algorithm
makes the most efficient use of memory?
Solution:
First-Fit:
212K is put in 500K partition.
417K is put in 600K partition.
112K is put in 200K partition.
426K must wait.
Best-Fit:
212K is put in 300K partition.
417K is put in 500K partition.
112K is put in 200K partition.
426K is put in 600K partition.
Worst-Fit:
212K is put in 600K partition.
417K is put in 500K partition.
112K is put in 300K partition.
426K must wait.
In this example, Best-Fit turns out to be the best.
